# Blockchain Naming - DNS

- This is a project website highlighting our efforts for a comparative study of DNS and blockchain-based Internet naming systems, using Ethereum Name System (ENS) as a representative of the latter. The study focuses on three aspects: namespace assignment control, name authentication support, and name resolution process and associated cost.
